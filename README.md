# Airbnb-Homestay-Price-Prediction
Using both institutional characters and demographic information to predict Airbnb homestay price

### Variable selection
- Institutional characters include variables such as the bedroom number of homestay, the distance to metro station, and the cleanness rate of the homestay.
- Demographic information includes the economic indicator, like the GDP per capita and house prices in each country.

### Model selection
I selected both parametric and non-parametric models to make prediction.
- Parametric model: Linear Regression model
- Non-parametric models: Decision Tree model, Random Forest model, and XGBoost Model.

XGBoost model reaches the best prediction performance: around 60\% prediction accuracy.

### Inference application
I explored the most important features related to the prediction of homestay prices so that the government can enact more suitable housing policy or tax policy,
